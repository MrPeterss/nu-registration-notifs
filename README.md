# Northeastern Registration Notifications
 
A simple python app (writen in Juypiter Notebooks) that will send notifications when a seat opens in a class.

## How it works
Uses unprotected GET HTTP requests from Northeastern University Registration to pull class information about the amount of seats available in a class given its Class Reference Number (CRN). This app will send a text message when the class has a new seat.
